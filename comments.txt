I didn't understand that the repo should be forked on the browser to my own github account and then clone my forked repo, so that caused troubles on (9.b) because I ended up with two remotes pointing to the same (origin and upstream). What I did was clone the original repo and worked from there, then added an upstream remote pointing to the original and changed the origin url to my own (after forking it manually on the browser).
